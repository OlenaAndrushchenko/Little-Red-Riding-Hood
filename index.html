                    <p>Once upon a time there was sweet little girl. Everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood, because she always wore a red riding hood. It had been given to her by her grandmother, who loved the little girl very much.</p>
                    <p>One day Little Red Riding Hood’s mother said, “Here, child, take this basket to your grandmother. It’s got bread, butter, cake and berries in it. She’s feeling sick and I hope this will make her feel better. Don’t talk to strangers, don’t leave the path and walk straight to your grandma’s house. “</p>

                    <p>Little Red Riding Hood’s grandmother lived half an hour away in the woods outside the village. So Little Red Riding Hood set off. The girl had just entered the woods, when a wolf came out of the trees. She wasn’t scared because she didn’t know wolves are dangerous.</p>
                    <p>“Good day, Little Red Riding Hood”, the wolf greeted her. “Good day, Mr Wolf”, the girl replied. “Where are you going?” he asked. “I’m going to visit my grandmother, because she isn’t feeling very well”, Little Red Riding Hood replied. </p>
